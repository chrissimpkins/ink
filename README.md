# What is ink?

ink is an open source stream editor and text file template renderer that is built with Go. The ink executable is compiled for use on [Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/ink/releases/latest).  It was designed to provide a simple approach to get command line executable text data into pre-formatted text files.

It features:

- line filter stream editor support (pipe replacement text from other applications to ink, render your template with the standard input piped text, then pipe the rendered text to the standard output stream for file writes or further text processing)
- support for parallel multi-file text replacements from local and remotely stored (GET request accessible) templates
- a simple built-in text template format using `{{ ink }}` text labels
- extremely flexible user defined text template formatting that supports *nearly any text replacement label*â„¢ that you'd like to use.  This is defined at rendering time on the command line.

### Example

##### CSS template file

The CSS template is available on the path `hack.css.in` in this example; however, it is possible to store the template file remotely on a server where it is accessible by GET request and use the URL in place of the local file path to accomplish the same local text file render as demonstrated in this example.

```css
/*!
 *  Hack typeface https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack
 *  License: https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/blob/master/LICENSE.md
 */
/* FONT PATHS
 * -------------------------- */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Hack';
  src: url('fonts/hack-regular.woff2?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff2'), url('fonts/hack-regular.woff?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Hack';
  src: url('fonts/hack-bold.woff2?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff2'), url('fonts/hack-bold.woff?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff');
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Hack';
  src: url('fonts/hack-italic.woff2?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff2'), url('fonts/hack-italic.woff?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: italic;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Hack';
  src: url('fonts/hack-bolditalic.woff2?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff2'), url('fonts/hack-bolditalic.woff?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff');
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

##### Render template with a git commit SHA1 short code

The following is executed in the repository under git version control:

```
$ git log --pretty=format:'%h' --abbrev-commit -1 | ink hack.css.in
```

##### Rendered CSS file

After execution of the above command, the rendered CSS file with git commit SHA1 short code stamps in the font URL is available on the path `hack.css`:

```css
/*!
 *  Hack typeface https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack
 *  License: https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/blob/master/LICENSE.md
 */
/* FONT PATHS

  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {

}

```

## Installation

### Approach 1: Install the pre-compiled binary executable file

Download the latest compiled release file for your operating system and architecture from [the Releases page](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/ink/releases/latest).

#### Linux / macOS

Unpack the tar.gz archive and move the `ink` executable file to your `/usr/local/bin` directory by executing the following command in the root of the unpacked archive:

```
$ mv ink /usr/local/bin/ink
```

There are no dependencies contained in the archive.  You can delete all downloaded archive files after the above step.

#### Windows

Unpack the zip archive and move the `ink.exe` executable file to a directory on your system PATH. See [details here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4822400/register-an-exe-so-you-can-run-it-from-any-command-line-in-windows) for more information about how to do this.

There are no dependencies contained in the archive.  You can delete all downloaded archive files after the above step.

### Approach 2: Compile from the source code and install

You must install the Go programming language (which includes the `go` tool) in order to compile the project from source.  Follow the [instructions on the Go download page](https://golang.org/dl/) for your platform. 

Once you have installed Go and configured your settings so that Go executables are installed on your system PATH, use the following command to (1) pull the master branch of the ink repository; (2) compile the ink executable from source for your platform/architecture configuration; (3) install the executable on your system:

```
$ go get github.com/chrissimpkins/ink
```

## Usage

### Syntax

#### Local template file rendering

The following approach uses the built-in ink template syntax and file extension format to identify text replacement sites in the source document (see details below).

```
$ ink --replace=[replacement string] [options] [template path 1]...[template path n]
```

or 

```
$ [executable command stdout stream] | ink [options] [template path 1]...[template path n]
```

#### Remote template file rendering

The following approach uses the built-in ink template syntax and file extension format to identify text replacement sites in the source document (see details below).

```
$ ink --replace=[replacement string] [options] [template URL 1]...[template URL n]
```

or

```
$ [executable command stdout stream] | ink [options] [template URL 1]...[template URL n]
```

#### Stream editor text substitutions

The stream editor approach supports user-defined text replacement tokens in the source document. This permits you to define alternate template tokens in pre-formatted files and render template replacements as you would with template files that follow the ink template specification.  This approach also permits use of ink as a stream editor for routine find/replace text substitutions in the source document.

```
$ ink --find=[find string] --replace=[replacement string] [options] [template path 1]...[template path n]
```

or

```
$ [executable command stdout replacement stream] | ink --find=[find string] [options] [template path 1]...[template path n]
```

Remote text files can be streamed as the source text by replacing the template file paths with one or more GET request accessible URL as shown in the examples above.

You can create a pipeline from ink to additional applications (or define your own outfile path) by including the `--stdout` option in your command.

### Options

- `--find=` : find string value for user defined templates
- `-h, --help` : application help
- `--lint` : lint a template file for validity using the ink template file specification
- `--replace=` : replacement string value for template renders
- `--stdout` : write rendered text to standard output stream
- `--trimnl` : trim newline value from replacement string (intended for use with data piped through stdin stream)
- `--usage` : application usage
- `-v, --version` : application version

### How to define a replacement string on the command line

The replacement text for your template file can either be piped to `ink` through the standard input stream or you can include the `--replace=[replacement string]` option in the command.  These are mutually exclusive and one of the two approaches is mandatory with each command.

The following examples demonstrate how to achieve replacements with the same constant string literal using each approach:

```
$ echo "abcd123" | ink template.txt.in
$ ink --replace=abcd123 template.txt.in
```

and these examples demonstrate how to evaluate command line expressions and use the standard output data as the replacement text with each approach:

```
$ date | ink template.txt.in
$ ink --replace="$(date)" template.txt.in
```

### How to pipe a rendered template to the standard output stream

By default, `ink` writes the rendered text to a file located in the same directory as the template file on a file path that is defined by the removal of the `.in` file extension.  You can modify this behavior to pipe the data through the standard output stream instead of writing to disk by including the `--stdout` option in your command.

For example:

```
$ ink --replace=abcd123 --stdout template.txt.in
```

This will permit you to view the rendered text in your terminal or to pipe it to another application for further text processing.

Here is a Linux/macOS example of a pipeline to and from `ink` with a file write to the path `finalfile.txt` after further processing in the (fake) application `cooltxt`:

```
$ echo "abcd123" | ink template.txt.in | cooltxt --dothings > finalfile.txt
```

### Replacement Text Modification Options

#### Trim newline characters from replacement strings

Some command line executables include a newline character following the standard output text (including the echo executable examples above).  This is not always desirable in the replacement substring that is used in your template files.  To remove the newline character, include the `--trimnl` option in your command:

```
$ echo "abcd123" | ink --trimnl template.txt.in
```
 
## Template File Specifications

"Template file" is defined as any local or remote text file that is used as the source for text substitutions by inclusion of text replacement "tokens" in the document.

"Token" is defined as the set of glyphs, in user defined order, that are defined as intended for text substitution within "template files".

"Replacement text" is defined as the text intended for substitution at the site of a "token" in a template file.

"Outfile" is defined as a text file path that is the rendering artifact of the `ink` executable.  Note that this is intentionally distinct from a user specified file write during command line execution using shell idioms or other modalities.

### ink template specification

The ink template file is specified as follows:

- Template files that are rendered to outfiles MUST be defined by a path that includes the intended file path of the outfile with the addition of the extension `.in`.
- Template files that are used to pipe rendered text data to the standard output stream do not have a specified file path format.  Users may define any local or remote path when the `--stdout` option is used.  The addition of a `.in` extension to the desired render artifact file path for these template files is RECOMMENDED when file writes are performed with these streamed data.
- The template MAY include zero or more template tokens that are defined in a case-sensitive manner as `{{ink}}` or `{{ ink }}`.
- The template MAY include zero or more template tokens that are defined in a case-sensitive manner as `{{.Ink}}` or `{{ .Ink }}`.
- All template token glyphs up to and including the initial `{` and final `}` glyphs MUST be replaced with replacement text during each execution of the renderer.
- All template tokens contained in template files MUST be replaced with replacement text during each execution of the renderer.

### User-defined template specification

User-defined templates are specified as follows:

- Templates files MUST NOT use two adjacent `{` glyphs as the opening delimiter and two adjacent `}` glyphs as the closing delimiter in template tokens.
- Template files that are rendered to outfiles MUST be defined by a path that includes the intended file path of the rendered text outfile with the addition of the extension `.in`.
- Template files that are used to pipe rendered text data to the standard output stream do not have a specified source file path format.  Users may define any local or remote path when the `--stdout` option is used.  The addition of a `.in` extension to the desired render artifact file path for these template files is RECOMMENDED when file writes are performed with these streamed data.
- All template token glyphs in the order and case-sensitive definition specified on the command line MUST be replaced with the replacement text. 
- All template tokens contained in template files MUST be replaced with replacement text during each execution of the renderer.
