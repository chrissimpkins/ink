# What is ink?

ink is an open source command line text file template renderer that is built with Go. The ink executable is compiled for use on [Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms]((https://github.com/chrissimpkins/ink/releases/latest)).  It was designed to provide a simple approach to get your command line executable text data into pre-formatted text files.

It features:

- line filter support (pipe replacement text from other applications to ink, render your template with the standard input piped text, then pipe the rendered text to the standard output stream for file writes or further text processing)
- support for parallel multi-file renders from local and remotely stored (GET request accessible) templates
- a simple built-in text template format using `{{ ink }}` text labels
- extremely flexible user defined text template formatting that supports *any template format*â„¢ that you'd like to use (you define it on the command line)

### Example

##### CSS template file

The CSS template is available on the path `hack.css.in` in this example; however, it is possible to store the template file remotely on a server where it is accessible by GET request and use the URL in place of the local file path to accomplish the same local text file render as demonstrated in this example.

```css
/*!
 *  Hack typeface https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack
 *  License: https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/blob/master/LICENSE.md
 */
/* FONT PATHS
 * -------------------------- */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Hack';
  src: url('fonts/hack-regular.woff2?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff2'), url('fonts/hack-regular.woff?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Hack';
  src: url('fonts/hack-bold.woff2?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff2'), url('fonts/hack-bold.woff?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff');
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Hack';
  src: url('fonts/hack-italic.woff2?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff2'), url('fonts/hack-italic.woff?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: italic;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Hack';
  src: url('fonts/hack-bolditalic.woff2?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff2'), url('fonts/hack-bolditalic.woff?sha={{ ink }}') format('woff');
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

##### Render template with a git commit SHA1 short code

The following is executed in the repository under git version control:

```
$ git log --pretty=format:'%h' --abbrev-commit -1 | ink hack.css.in
```

##### Rendered CSS file

After execution of the above command, the rendered CSS file with git commit SHA1 short code stamps in the font URL is available on the path `hack.css`:

```css
/*!
 *  Hack typeface https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack
 *  License: https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/blob/master/LICENSE.md
 */
/* FONT PATHS
 * -------------------------- */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Hack';
  src: url('fonts/hack-regular.woff2?sha=db337ca') format('woff2'), url('fonts/hack-regular.woff?sha=db337ca') format('woff');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Hack';
  src: url('fonts/hack-bold.woff2?sha=db337ca') format('woff2'), url('fonts/hack-bold.woff?sha=db337ca') format('woff');
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Hack';
  src: url('fonts/hack-italic.woff2?sha=db337ca') format('woff2'), url('fonts/hack-italic.woff?sha=db337ca') format('woff');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: italic;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Hack';
  src: url('fonts/hack-bolditalic.woff2?sha=db337ca') format('woff2'), url('fonts/hack-bolditalic.woff?sha=db337ca') format('woff');
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: italic;
}

```

## Installation

### Approach 1: Install the pre-compiled binary executable file

Download the latest compiled release file for your operating system and architecture from [the Releases page](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/ink/releases/latest).

#### Linux / macOS

Unpack the tar.gz archive and move the `ink` executable file to your `/usr/local/bin` directory by executing the following command in the root of the unpacked archive:

```
$ mv ink /usr/local/bin/ink
```

There are no dependencies contained in the archive.  You can delete all downloaded archive files after the above step.

#### Windows

Unpack the zip archive and move the `ink.exe` executable file to a directory on your system PATH. See [details here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4822400/register-an-exe-so-you-can-run-it-from-any-command-line-in-windows) for more information about how to do this.

There are no dependencies contained in the archive.  You can delete all downloaded archive files after the above step.

### Approach 2: Compile from the source code and install

You must install the Go programming language (which includes the `go` tool) in order to compile the project from source.  Follow the [instructions on the Go download page](https://golang.org/dl/) for your platform. 

Once you have installed Go and configured your settings so that Go executables are installed on your system PATH, use the following command to (1) pull the master branch of the ink repository; (2) compile the ink executable from source for your platform/architecture configuration; (3) install the executable on your system:

```
$ go get github.com/chrissimpkins/ink
```

## Usage

### Syntax

#### Local template files

```
$ ink [options] [template path 1]...[template path n]
```

#### Remote template files

```
$ ink [options] [template URL 1]...[template URL n]
```
